# Groceryhawk

Groceryhawk was created as part of **CanadaHacks 2025**, hosted by **GDC**. Our mission is twofold:

1. **Help consumers understand the real discounts they’re getting**—because sometimes what looks like a “diamond in the rough” is really just a fake deal.  
2. **Provide enough data so people can make informed financial decisions**—especially important given Canada’s rising food costs.

## Our Approach

We started by gathering a massive amount of data, using a mix of AI and bots to scrape various sources. This allowed us to build an extensive database. Our next challenge was making the site user-friendly, and through careful planning, we managed to achieve that.

### Fast and Efficient Searches

We wanted users to efficiently compare and sort through our huge dataset, so we vectorized part of the database—making searches and comparisons incredibly fast. We also added a simple way for consumers to quickly check prices for specific items they’re interested in.

### Weekly Flyers: A Constant Stream of Fresh Data

We believe using weekly flyers was a stroke of genius because they’re updated every week, providing a constant source of new information.

### HawkBot Integration

Finally, we integrated **HawkBot** to boost accessibility and help with research, making it easier for more people to use and benefit from Gorecyhawk.
